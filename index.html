    Ambulances rushed to the scene yesterday as Santa’s sponsored leg wax for the Elf Hospital took a tragic turn.  
    Paramedics were called to the community centre in Bobblehatville, when Santa had an allergic reaction to the leg
    wax used in his sponsored leg wax.  Witnesses report Santa laughing with the crowd as he rolled up his trouser leg,
    but only minutes later was passed out on the floor covered in a rash with his leg swelling up enormously.  
    One onlooker said, “It was so scary, you just don’t think something like that will happen to Santa, he’s such
    a brave and kind man”, a spokesperson for the community centre said they were very distressed at the occurrence, 
    and although Santa had no known previous allergies, this was a very unfortunate incident.

    Reports from the hospital are that Santa is making a speedy recovery, Mrs Claus has been at his bedside and there
    have been numerous gifts and flowers from well wishers hoping for his speedy recovery.
    
    ‘Give your’elf a break’, the beauty company who were involved in the sponsored leg wax, wished to assure their 
    customers that a reaction like this is extremely rare, and wanted to remind Elves across the city that they had a two
    for one promotion on for mani-pedis.

    The Family Fayre restaurant in CandyCane Lane has been closed indefinitely
    after out-of-date mince pies and Christmas pudding were served to customers. 
    Several customers reported feeling unwell, and the restaurant, which only opened a 
    few weeks ago, has had to shut after inspectors visited the premises.  This will be 
    a major blow to locals as the opening of the restaurant was awaited with much anticipation.
    If you have been to the Family Fayre restaurant and have felt unwell, 
    please get in touch with your story.
